how do i list the devices plugged into my mac

You can list plugged-in devices using the macOS interface (easiest) or the Terminal (best for detailed technical specs).

Method 1: System Information (GUI)
This is the built-in utility for viewing all hardware connected to your system.

Click the Apple Menu () in the top-left corner.

Hold down the Option (⌥) key. You will see "About This Mac" change to System Information...

Click System Information.

In the left sidebar, look under the Hardware section:

USB: Lists all USB devices (hubs, keyboards, drives, etc.).

Thunderbolt/USB4: Lists high-speed Thunderbolt docks, drives, or monitors.

Bluetooth: Lists wirelessly connected devices.

Tip: This list does not update live. If you plug in a new device while this window is open, press Cmd + R to refresh the list.

Method 2: Terminal Commands (CLI)
Since you are a developer, you might prefer these commands for quick checks or piping into other scripts.

1. List all USB devices (Detailed) This outputs the same data as the System Information app but in text format.

Bash
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
2. List all Thunderbolt devices

Bash
system_profiler SPThunderboltDataType
3. List USB devices in a Tree View (Compact) This is often easier to read than system_profiler if you just need to see what is connected to what hub.

Bash
ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l
-p IOUSB: Shows only USB plane.

-w0: Prevents line truncation.

-l: Shows properties (optional, remove for a cleaner tree structure).

4. List only External Storage If you are specifically looking for mounted drives/volumes:

Bash
diskutil list external
Troubleshooting
If a device isn't showing up: Check the Power section in System Information. If a device requires more power than the port can provide (common with older unpowered USB hubs), it may be listed there but disabled.

Serial Devices: If you are looking for a dev board (like an Arduino or ESP32), list the serial ports directly:

Bash
ls /dev/cu.*
Cool I see Elements 2621 plugged in. How can I see what's on it?

Since "Elements 2621" (likely a Western Digital external hard drive) is detected by the system, it should be mounted as a volume. You can view its contents using the Terminal or Finder.

Method 1: via Terminal (CLI)
Since you are already likely in the terminal, this is the quickest check. macOS mounts all external storage to the /Volumes directory.

1. List the files directly: Use quotes to handle the space in the name.

Bash
ls -F /Volumes/"Elements 2621"/
2. Navigate into the drive:

Bash
cd /Volumes/"Elements 2621"
If you get a "No such file or directory" error: This means the device is plugged in (physically detected) but the filesystem is not mounted. Check the "Troubleshooting" section below.

Method 2: via Finder (GUI)
Open a new Finder window.

Look at the Sidebar on the left. Under Locations, you should see an icon named Elements 2621. Click it to see the files.

If it's not in the sidebar:

Press Shift + Cmd + C (Go to Computer).

This view shows all mounted volumes (Macintosh HD, Network drives, and your Elements drive). Double-click "Elements 2621" to open it.

Troubleshooting: "I see it in the device list, but not in /Volumes"
If system_profiler sees it but you can't access files, the drive might be unmounted or using a file system macOS can't read (like Linux ext4).

1. Check mount status: Run this to see if macOS recognizes the partition:

Bash
diskutil list
Look for "Elements 2621" in the output. Note the identifier on the right (e.g., disk2s1).

2. Force mount: If you see it in the list but not in Finder, try mounting it manually using that identifier:

Bash
diskutil mount disk2s1
(Replace disk2s1 with the actual identifier from the previous step).

Would you like me to help you format or unmount the drive safely once you are done?

ls: /Volumes/Elements 2621/: No such file or directory

This error usually happens because "Elements 2621" is the hardware name (the name of the USB device), but the volume name (the folder you access) is named something else.

Here is how to find the actual mount path.

1. Find the Volume Name
Run this command to list your external drives and their partition names:

Bash
diskutil list external
Look at the output under the NAME column.

You might see your drive listed as disk2 or disk3.

Under that, look for the partition name. It might be named Untitled, My Passport, or something different than "Elements 2621".

2. If you see the correct name
If you find the name (e.g., "Backups"), try listing that instead:

Bash
ls -F /Volumes/"Backups"/
3. If the NAME column is empty or greyed out
If the drive is listed but lacks a volume name or isn't mounted:

Note the IDENTIFIER (e.g., disk2s1).

Try to mount it manually:

Bash
diskutil mount disk2s1
Still stuck? If diskutil shows the drive but you can't mount it, the file system might be formatted for Windows (NTFS) or Linux (ext4), or it might be encrypted.

You can check the file system type in the TYPE column of the diskutil output (e.g., Windows_NTFS). Let me know if you see a non-Mac file system there.

                    (free space)                         135.2 MB   -

Based on that output, the issue is definitely the name mismatch.

The output shows your external drive is /dev/disk4.

Hardware Name: Elements 2621 (what the system sees).

Volume Name: Elements (what the file system is named).

You can see this on line 2 of the /dev/disk4 entry: 2: Apple_HFS Elements 2.0 TB disk4s2

The Fix
Try listing it using the volume name Elements:

Bash
ls -F /Volumes/Elements/
If that still returns "No such file"
It means the volume disk4s2 is recognized but not currently mounted. You can force mount it with:

Bash
diskutil mount disk4s2
(Then run the ls command again).

ls /Volumes just shows:

google/       Macintosh HD/

This confirms the drive is physically connected but not mounted, which is why you can't see the files yet.

Since we identified the partition as disk4s2 in your previous diskutil output, you can force it to mount manually.

1. Mount the drive
Run this command:

Bash
diskutil mount disk4s2
2. Check the output
Success: You should see Volume Elements on disk4s2 mounted.

Failure: If you see an error like "Volume failed to mount," the file system might need repair (let me know if this happens).

3. List the files
Once it says it's mounted, run the list command again:

Bash
ls -F /Volumes/Elements/
how long should that take?

It should be almost instant (1–5 seconds).

However, since this is a 2TB mechanical drive formatted as HFS+ (Apple_HFS), if it wasn't ejected properly last time or if the file system is "dirty," macOS will automatically run a file system check (fsck) before allowing it to mount.

If it's taking longer than 10 seconds: It is likely running that check in the background. For a 2TB drive, this can take anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes depending on how many files are on it.

How to check if it's working (since you are comfortable with CLI)
Open a new terminal tab (Cmd+T) and run this to see if the repair process is active:

Bash
ps aux | grep fsck
If you see a process like fsck_hfs running: Let it finish. It's repairing the directory structure.

If nothing is running and diskutil is just hanging: The mount process might be stuck. You can try pressing Ctrl + C to cancel the command, unplug the drive, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in.

Volume on disk4s2 failed to mount

If you think the volume is supported but damaged, try the "readOnly" option

This error confirms the file system (the index of where your files are) is corrupted. This often happens if the drive was unplugged without ejecting or if it lost power.

Here is the safest path forward to try and get your data.

Option 1: Mount Read-Only (Safest)
This mounts the drive in a "locked" state where you can view and copy files off, but you cannot save or delete anything on it. This prevents further corruption.

Run this command:

Bash
diskutil mount readOnly disk4s2
If this works:

The drive will appear in Finder/Terminal.

Immediately copy your important files to your Mac or another drive.

Once backed up, you can reformat the drive to fix it permanently.

Option 2: Repair the Volume
If the "readOnly" command above fails, or if you want to try to fix the drive so it works normally again, you can run macOS's repair tool.

Warning: This creates heavy load on the drive. If the drive is physically failing (making clicking noises), do not do this. Skip to data recovery software.

If the drive sounds normal, run:

Bash
diskutil repairVolume disk4s2
This process can take a while (15 mins to hours).

Do not unplug the drive while this is running.

If it says "The volume Elements was repaired successfully," try mounting it normally (diskutil mount disk4s2).

diskutil mount readOnly disk4s2

Volume on disk4s2 failed to mount

If you think the volume is supported but damaged, try the "readOnly" option

If readOnly also failed, the directory structure of the drive is likely corrupted enough that macOS cannot even mount it safely to read the file index.

Since you are comfortable with the CLI, we can try two things: a lower-level manual mount (which gives better error messages) and the actual repair process.

Step 1: Try a Low-Level Mount (Sudo)
diskutil is a high-level wrapper. Using the raw mount command can sometimes bypass checks or tell us why it's failing (e.g., "Input/output error" vs "Invalid argument").

Create a temporary mount point:

Bash
sudo mkdir /Volumes/RescueMode
Attempt to force mount as Read-Only HFS+:

Bash
sudo mount -t hfs -o rdonly /dev/disk4s2 /Volumes/RescueMode
If this works: You will see no output. Go to /Volumes/RescueMode and copy your data immediately.

If it fails: It will likely give a specific error.

Step 2: Run the Repair (fsck)
If the mount above failed, the file system needs to be repaired.

⚠️ Warning: If the drive is making clicking/grinding noises, STOP. Repairing a physically failing drive will destroy it. If it sounds normal (just spinning), proceed.

Ensure the process isn't already running:

Bash
ps aux | grep fsck
If you see fsck_hfs running on disk4s2, let it finish. It is already trying to fix itself.

Run the repair command:

Bash
diskutil repairVolume disk4s2
What to expect:

"FileSystem is clean" / "Repaired successfully": You are good. Try mounting normally.

"Overlapped extent allocation": Files are overwriting each other. The tool might truncate them to save the drive structure.

"Underlying task reported failure": The native tool cannot fix it. You will likely need third-party data recovery software (like Disk Drill) to scrape the files, or you will need to reformat the drive (wiping the data) to use it again.

ADditional info: I'm doing this on my work laptop, which can *only* do readonly

This is the critical piece of the puzzle. If your work laptop enforces a "Read-Only" policy (common for Data Loss Prevention), that security software is likely intercepting and blocking the mount process because macOS's default behavior is to attempt a Read/Write mount first.

Even when you manually typed diskutil mount readOnly, the corporate security agent might still be blocking the device entirely because it hasn't scanned/verified it.

STOP: Do not run diskutil repairVolume. Repairing requires Write access. Since your laptop blocks write access, the repair command will fail immediately or, worse, hang indefinitely.

Here is how to bypass the standard mount process and force a read-only mount at the kernel level.

Step 1: The "Sudo" Force Mount
The standard diskutil command often gets tripped up by corporate policies. We will use the raw Unix mount command instead.

Create a temporary folder to mount the drive to:

Bash
sudo mkdir /Volumes/Rescue
(Type your laptop password if prompted. You won't see the characters typing).

Force mount the drive specifically as Read-Only:

Bash
sudo mount -t hfs -o rdonly /dev/disk4s2 /Volumes/Rescue
Check if it worked:

Bash
ls -F /Volumes/Rescue/
Step 2: Check System Logs (If Step 1 fails)
If the command above gives you "Permission denied" or "Operation not permitted," it means your company's security software (like CrowdStrike, Santa, or Symantec) is blocking the hardware ID of the drive entirely.

You can confirm this by checking the logs:

Bash
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "disk4"' --last 1m
Scan the output for words like "Denied," "Policy," or "Block."

If you see these words: There is no CLI workaround. The laptop is configured to reject this specific unencrypted or non-whitelisted drive. You will need to plug it into a non-work computer to access the files.

If you see "I/O Error": The drive is physically corrupted.

Let me know what the sudo mount command returns.

juliettelove-mac:~ juliettelove$ sudo mount -t hfs -o rdonly /dev/disk4s2 /Volumes/Rescue

mount_hfs: error on mount(): error = -1.

mount_hfs: Invalid argument

mount: /Volumes/Rescue failed with 1

juliettelove-mac:~ juliettelove$ log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "disk4"' --last 1m

Filtering the log data using "composedMessage CONTAINS "disk4""

Skipping info and debug messages, pass --info and/or --debug to include.

Activity - Create:           0, Transition:          0, Actions:           0

This log tells us exactly what is happening. You are stuck in a Journaling Catch-22.

The Diagnosis:

The Error: hfs: late journal init: ... journal is dirty.

The Cause: The drive was likely unplugged without ejecting last time, leaving unfinished file transactions in the HFS+ journal.

The Conflict: To mount the drive safely, macOS must replay the journal (write to the drive) to clean it up. However, your work laptop (or the command flags) are enforcing Read-Only.

Result: macOS refuses to mount it because it can't fix the journal, and it won't show you a "dirty" file system because the data might be inconsistent.

The Fix: Force Mount ignoring the Journal
Since you just want to see the files and not write new ones, you can tell the kernel to ignore the dirty journal and skip the recovery process.

Run this command:

Bash
sudo mount -t hfs -o rdonly,norecovery /dev/disk4s2 /Volumes/Rescue
rdonly: Keeps your security software happy.

norecovery: Tells HFS+ "Do not replay the journal." It essentially says, "I don't care if the file system is inconsistent, just show me what is there."

If that works:

List the files: ls -F /Volumes/Rescue/

Copy what you need immediately.

If that fails: Your only option is to plug this drive into a non-work Mac (one that allows Write access).

Plug it in.

macOS will automatically detect the dirty journal, replay it (fix it), and mount the drive.

Eject it safely.

Bring it back to your work laptop—it should now mount cleanly in Read-Only mode.

Would you like me to clarify any of those flags?
