I strained a tendon at the base of my hamstring. How should I tape it up as I ease back into running?

This sounds like a "high hamstring" strain (proximal hamstring tendinopathy), which can be particularly stubborn for runners because that specific tendon compresses against your sit bone (ischial tuberosity) when you run, especially uphill or at speed.

Standard rigid sports tape is often too restrictive for the hamstring's large range of motion. Kinesiology tape (K-Tape) is generally the better choice here; it provides sensory feedback and blood flow support without mechanically locking your leg in place.

Here is a step-by-step guide to taping it up, followed by tips for your return to running.

⚠️ Important Disclaimers
Not Medical Advice: I am an AI, not a physiotherapist. If you have significant pain, bruising, or inability to walk without limping, see a professional.

Skin Prep: Ensure your skin is clean, dry, and free of lotion. Shaving the area helps the tape stick better and hurts less to remove.

The "High Hamstring" Taping Technique
You will need two strips of kinesiology tape.

1. Preparation

Strip A (Long): Measure from your sit bone (the hard bone you sit on) down to just below the back of your knee.

Strip B (Short): A shorter strip, about 4–6 inches long.

Round the corners: Use scissors to round the corners of both strips. Sharp corners catch on clothing and peel off easily.

2. Body Position (Critical)

Stand up and bend forward at the waist, keeping your legs straight (or with a very slight micro-bend). You want to put the hamstring and skin on a stretch before applying the tape. If you apply it while standing straight, it will bunch up and fall off the moment you move.

3. Application

Step 1: The Long Support Strip

Tear the backing paper at one end (about 2 inches).

Anchor this end with 0% stretch right over your ischial tuberosity (sit bone) or slightly onto the lower glute.

Peel the backing paper down as you lay the tape along the hamstring muscle belly towards the knee. Apply with light stretch (approx. 15–25%).

Lay the final 2 inches behind the knee with 0% stretch.

Step 2: The Decompression Strip (The "Band-Aid")

Take the shorter strip and tear the backing paper in the middle.

Peel the paper back so you are holding the two ends.

Stretch the middle section to 50–75% tension.

Place this directly perpendicular (horizontal) over the point of maximum pain (usually right near the glute fold).

Lay down the two ends with 0% stretch.

Step 3: Activate

Rub the tape vigorously with your hand for 30 seconds. The heat activates the adhesive.

Easing Back Into Running
Taping is a tool, not a cure. The placement of high hamstring tendon strains means they are easily aggravated by over-striding and hills.

1. The "Uphill" Rule Avoid hills for now. Running uphill requires high hip flexion, which compresses the tendon against the bone. Stick to flat, predictable surfaces.

2. Shorten Your Stride Over-striding (landing with your foot far out in front of you) puts maximum tensile load on the high hamstring.

Tip: Try to increase your cadence (steps per minute) slightly. This naturally forces your feet to land underneath your hips, reducing the strain on the tendon.

3. Monitor "Next Day" Pain Tendons are tricky because they often feel "warmed up" and fine during the run, only to flare up 24 hours later.

The 24-Hour Test: If your pain is worse the morning after a run than it was the morning before, you did too much. Scale back the distance or speed.

4. Avoid Deep Static Stretching While it feels good to stretch a tight hamstring, stretching a strained high tendon can actually delay healing because it compresses the injured tissue against the sit bone. Focus on dynamic warm-ups (leg swings) rather than static "toe-touch" stretches.

Would you like a recommendation for specific strengthening exercises (isometrics) that are safe to do before you start running?

The strain is at the top of my knee, not by my glute

Thanks for the correction. That changes things—you are dealing with a distal hamstring strain (where the muscle turns into tendon and attaches below the knee).

This area is mechanically different because it controls the bending of your knee and the deceleration of your lower leg when you swing it forward.

Here is the specific taping technique for the "low" hamstring/back of the knee.

The "Distal Hamstring" Taping Technique
You will need one long strip (or a "Y" strip) and one short strip.

1. Preparation

Strip A (Long): Measure from the top of your calf (just below the knee crease) up to the middle of your thigh.

Strip B (Short): About 4–6 inches long (for the "Band-Aid" effect).

Round the corners on all strips.

2. Body Position

Stand up and put your weight on your uninjured leg.

Extend the injured leg slightly behind you with the knee straight. This puts the skin and fascia on a stretch.

3. Application

Step 1: The Support Strip (Upward Flow)

Anchor the tape 2 inches below the back of your knee (on the upper calf). Anchor with 0% stretch.

Option A (General Pain): Run the tape straight up the center of the back of your thigh.

Option B (Specific Side): If the pain is distinctly on the outside (biceps femoris) or inside (semitendinosus), angle the tape to follow that specific muscle line up the thigh.

Apply with light stretch (15–25%) as you cross the back of the knee and go up the thigh.

Lay the final 2 inches down with 0% stretch.

Step 2: The Decompression Strip

Bend your knee slightly now (about 20 degrees).

Tear the backing of the short strip in the middle.

Stretch the middle to 50–75% tension.

Apply it horizontally directly over the specific spot that hurts the most (usually right above the knee crease).

Lay the ends down with 0% stretch.

Step 3: Activate

Rub the tape vigorously to heat the adhesive.

Revised Running Tips for Distal Strains
Since the injury is at the knee, the risks are different than a high hamstring strain.

1. Beware the "Knee Snap" The distal hamstring works hardest to "brake" your lower leg right before your foot hits the ground.

The Risk: Sprinting or sudden acceleration.

The Fix: Keep your pace steady. Avoid intervals or "kicking" at the end of a run for now.

2. Watch Out for Downhills While uphills hurt high hamstrings, downhills hurt low hamstrings.

Running downhill forces your knee to extend and the hamstring to work eccentrically to control that extension.

Tip: If you can, run on a flat track or treadmill to control the gradient. If you must run outside, take downhills very slowly/walk them.

3. The "Shoe Removal" Check Interestingly, one of the most common ways to aggravate a low hamstring strain is taking off your shoes.

Why: Scuffing one shoe off with the toe of the other foot requires a forceful contraction of the distal hamstring.

Tip: Untie your shoes and take them off with your hands.

Would you like to know which specific stretching moves you should avoid for a distal strain?

sure

Here are the specific stretches to avoid while your distal hamstring heals.

The "Golden Rule" for this injury is: Do not force the knee completely straight while flexing the hip.

When the strain is at the back of the knee, locking your leg out puts maximum tensile load exactly on the injured tissue.

🛑 Stretches to Avoid
1. The Standing Toe Touch

The Move: Standing with legs straight and reaching for your toes.

Why it’s bad: It is very difficult to control the tension. Gravity pulls your torso down, and people tend to "lock" their knees backward to reach further. This hyperextension aggressively pulls at the tendon attachment site.

2. The Hurdler’s Stretch

The Move: Sitting on the ground with one leg straight out and the other tucked in, reaching for the foot.

Why it’s bad: This often adds a rotational force (torque) to the knee joint. Since the hamstring tendons also help stabilize rotation at the knee, this twists the injured fibers while stretching them.

3. The "Strap" or "Rope" Stretch

The Move: Lying on your back, looping a strap around your foot, and pulling your straight leg up into the air.

Why it’s bad: This removes your body's natural "brakes." The leverage of the strap allows you to pull the tendon far past its current safe range of motion without realizing it until the damage is done.

4. Ballistic Kicks

The Move: Swinging your leg high and fast (like a tin soldier) to warm up.

Why it’s bad: The momentum forces the muscle to lengthen rapidly. If the muscle can't catch the movement in time, the force goes straight into the injured tendon.

💡 The "False Tightness" Trap
You will likely feel a sensation that your hamstring is "tight" and needs to be stretched. Ignore this.

After a strain, your body creates "protective tension" (a neural splint) to prevent you from over-lengthening the injured area. If you stretch that tightness away, you are removing the body's natural cast, leaving the weak tissue vulnerable.

✅ A Safer Alternative
If you feel you must mobilize the area, do Active Knee Extensions instead of static stretches:

Lie on your back.

Hold the back of your thigh (injured leg) with both hands, hip bent at 90 degrees.

Slowly straighten your knee just until you feel the very first sign of resistance.

Immediately back off/bend the knee again.

Repeat rhythmically 10 times. Do not hold the extended position.
